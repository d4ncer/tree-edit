#+TITLE: Tree-edit.el - Structural editing for anyâ„¢ language!

#+begin_quote
You want to change the structure of a program. You figure out what series of
text editing operations, operations that manipulate a 2D grid of characters, are
equivalent to the change in the code you desire. What a waste of time and
energy.

Tree-edit is an attempt to realize the dream of development based on the
*intent* of the user, abstracting away the process of manually typing out
syntax.
