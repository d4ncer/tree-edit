#+TITLE: Rolling your own tree-edit commands

More documentation coming...

* Evil style
Something like a [[https://github.com/noctuid/lispyville][lispyville]] may be of interest for those who prefer to be in
normal mode. Here's some simple examples of how you could implement that:

#+begin_src elisp
(evil-define-operator my/tree-edit-delete (beg end)
  "Delete node between BEG and END, if possible."
  (let ((node (tsc-get-named-descendant-for-position-range
               (tsc-root-node tree-sitter-tree) beg end)))
    (tree-edit-delete node)))

(evil-define-operator my/tree-edit-raise (beg end)
  "Raise node between BEG and END, if possible."
  (let ((node (tsc-get-named-descendant-for-position-range
               (tsc-root-node tree-sitter-tree) beg end)))
    (tree-edit-raise node)))

(evil-define-key '(normal visual) global-map "gk" #'my/tree-edit-delete)
(evil-define-key '(normal visual) global-map "g/" #'my/tree-edit-raise)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

One thing to be careful of is whitespace: for example if you want to raise an
identifier, typing =g/w= on a word would include the whitespace and would select
the surrounding node instead (So =g/e= should be used). Similarly with text
objects selecting the entire line.

* Emacs style

#+begin_src elisp
(defun my/tree-edit-raise-word ()
  (interactive)
  (pcase-let* ((`(,beg . ,end) (bounds-of-thing-at-point 'word))
               (node (tsc-get-named-descendant-for-position-range
                      (tsc-root-node tree-sitter-tree) beg end)))
    (tree-edit-raise node)))

(define-key (current-global-map) (kbd "M-r") #'my/tree-edit-raise-word)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: my/tree-edit-raise-word
